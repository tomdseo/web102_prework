# WEB102 Prework - X6

Submitted by: Dong Hyun Seo

X6 is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [X] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [X] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
Adjusted color schema so it is high contrast and relevant to the organization's theme color
Increased font size and added hover glow effect for all 3 buttons within the Our Games section
Custom Feature: Hide email and phone contact information and let it be toggled with buttons: Great for saving webpage space and only showing information upon user's request.

* [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
I can incorporate a search bar within the Our Games section to allow users to search for specific games they want to find
I can program the cards to be in collapsed format and allow the user to expand them to see the game details such as the description, pledged amount, goal, and backers 
in order to save webpage space in case Sea Monster scales up and more games are added to the library.
I can store cookies so that the site remembers where the user left off on the site.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had to turn to the notes on the codepath site to implement the use destructuring and the spread operator to grab the first and second games.
It took some time to understand the pattern and logic of destructuring and the spread operator, but because I had prior Python knowledge, it helped me understand.
